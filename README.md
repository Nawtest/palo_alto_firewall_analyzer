# Palo Alto Firewall Analyzer

![Build](https://github.com/moshekaplan/palo_alto_firewall_analyzer/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

Python3 scripts for reviewing and fixing Palo Alto Firewall configurations

This repository contains the following user scripts:

* `pan_policy_validator.py` - Detects Palo Alto Network firewall configuration issues
* `pan_policy_fixer.py` - Fixes detected Palo Alto Network firewall configuration issues

The validators are designed to have as few false positives as possible. If there is a false positive, please [report an issue](https://github.com/moshekaplan/palo_alto_firewall_analyzer/issues/new)!

## Quickstart

The first time you launch the analyzer, it will create a `PAN_CONFIG.cfg` file
in `"~\.pan_policy_analyzer\` and instruct you to edit it.
The second time you launch the analyzer it will detect that "API_KEY.txt" is not present,
and will prompt you for credentials and save the retrieved API key to "API_KEY.txt"

* Run all non-API validators on all device groups:
`pan_policy_validator.py --all --no-api`

* Run all validators on all device groups (this may take a long time):
`pan_policy_validator.py --all`

* Run a single validator on a single device group:
`pan_policy_validator.py --device-group my_device_group --validator UnusedServices`

* Run a single validator on all device groups:
`pan_policy_validator.py --all --validator UnusedServices`

* Run all non-API validators on an XML configuration file downloaded with "Export Panorama configuration version":
`pan_policy_validator.py --all --xml 12345.xml`

If you're not sure where to start, I recommend downloading an XML file from:
`Panorama -> Setup -> Operations -> Export Panorama configuration version` and running: `pan_policy_validator.py --all --xml 12345.xml`

## Common Workflows
There are a few common workflows to clean the firewall configuration:

### Consolidate Service Objects
Consolidate Service objects so there is only one object for each Service:
* Delete unused Service objects: `python pan_policy_fixer --all --fixer DeleteUnusedServices`
* Check if any Service objects have misleading names: `python pan_policy_validator --all --validator MisleadingServices`
* Consolidate service objects in use: `python pan_policy_fixer --all --fixer ConsolidateServices`
* Delete the now-unused Service objects: `python pan_policy_fixer --all --fixer DeleteUnusedServices`
* Define a convention in the config file, then rename to fit the naming convention: `python pan_policy_fixer --all --fixer RenameUnconventionallyNamedServices`

### Consolidate Address Objects
Consolidate Address objects so there is only one object for each target:
* Delete unused Address objects: `python pan_policy_fixer.py --all --fixer DeleteUnusedAddresses`
* Delete Address objects with FQDNs that don't resolve: `python pan_policy_validator.py --all --validator BadHostname`
* Check if any Address objects have IPs in FQDNs: `python pan_policy_validator.py --all --validator FQDNContainsIP`
* Check if any Address objects have misleading names: `python pan_policy_validator.py --all --validator MisleadingAddresses`
* Replace Address objects using IPs with FQDNs: `python pan_policy_validator.py --all --fixer FixIPWithResolvingFQDN`
* Consolidate Address objects in use: `python pan_policy_fixer.py --all --fixer ConsolidateAddresses`
* Delete the now-unused Address objects: `python pan_policy_fixer.py --all --fixer DeleteUnusedAddresses`
* Make all FQDN objects use FQDNs: `python pan_policy_validator.py --all --fixer FixUnqualifiedFQDN`
* Define a convention in the config file, then rename objects to fit a naming convention: `python pan_policy_fixer --all --fixer RenameUnconventionallyNamedAddresses`


## Known Issues

The validators for checking zones (ExtaZones, MissingZones, and ExtraRules) all
require looking up the zones for address objects on the firewall. This requires many API
requests and can take a very long time. Given that PA recommends limiting the number of
concurrent API calls to five, and that's shared among the web UI, these calls are not
parallelized. If you don't need those validators, run with `--no-api` to skip them.
